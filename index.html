    <p align="center">But that's not all; at night, join us in the backroom as our resident DJ spins a choice selection of trance and drum&bass beats across our spacious tiki-themed dance floor.

If you've had enough of the beat, just head back to the lounge area to relax. And, no matter where you find yourself in the lounge, you'll always be connected with our wireless Internet access.
